# NHLRealPlusMinus

The goal of this project is to produce a "Real +/-" as well as a "Real Corsi" for every NHL player over 1250 miuntes over the last 3 seasons at 5v5 based on the paper [Adjusted Plus-Minus for NHL Players using
Ridge Regression with Goals, Shots, Fenwick, and Corsi](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.0317.pdf) by Brian MacDonald.
